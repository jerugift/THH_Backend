Experience of the candidate using the below needed skills_required:
Relevant Experience
must_have Experience
Good_to_have Experience

Skills_required  = [ job_title: must_have:  Python (3 years), machine learning (0 years), HTML (1.8 years), CSS (1.8 years) good_to_have : Numpy (3 years), Scipy (1.8 years), Pandas (1.8 years), Dask (0 years), spaCy (0 years), NLTK (0 years), PyTorch (0 years), JavaScript (0 years), SQL (0 years), NoSQL (0 years), Django (3 years), Flask (0 years), Pyramid (0 years), AWS (1.2 years), Google Cloud (0 years), Azure (0 years) locations: experiences: 3+ ]

Demo Answer calculation :
Dontprint below data [ Below data is for reference how to calculate the Relevant Experience ,must_have  Experience , Good_to_have Experience:

Relevant Experience:
Expected experience is 3+ , So taking the last 3 years projects namely :
Project : Bath & Body Works, Reynoldsburg, OH (Dec 2019 – May 2021)Skills: Python, Django, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Boto3, AWS (VPC, EC2, S3, ELB, Autoscaling Groups, EBS, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch), XML, JSON, Bootstrap, PyTest, PyUnit, PyQuery, REST API, Jenkins, GIT, Jira, Agile, Windows.
Project: Auto-Owners Insurance, Lansing, MI (Jan 2018 – Nov 2019)Skills: Python, Django, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Boto3, AWS, EC2, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JSON, MySQL, Jenkins, GIT, Agile, Linux.
must_have:  Python,machine learning, HTML, CSS . so , from the above two projects:
1st skill of the must_have is python , so python is mentioned in that two projects . so ,for must_have skills we give 2 points . so 2 * 3 (3 is given as the last two projects total duration is 3 years)
So , Python :6   likewise
        machine learning : 0 (0 is given for machine learning , as machine learning is not mentioned in both the projects)
HTML : 3.6
CSS  : 3.6
( HTML and CSS is is mentioned in the second project only . so , second project duration is 1.8 years . so multiplying 2 with 1.8 )
good_to_have : Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Dask, spaCy, NLTK, PyTorch, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, Django, Flask, Pyramid, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
    1st skill of the good_to_have is Numpy , so Numpy is mentioned in that two projects . so ,for good_to_have skills we give 1 points . so 1 * 3 (3 is given as the last two projects total duration is 3 years)
    So , Numpy :3   likewise
        Scipy : 1.8
Pandas : 1.8
( Scipy and Pandas is is mentioned in the second project only . so , the second project duration is 1.8 years . so multiplying 2 with 1.8 )
Dask : 0
spaCy : 0
NLTK : 0
PyTorch :  0
JavaScript : 0
SQL : 0
NoSQL : 0
Django : 3
Flask : 0
Pyramid : 0
AWS : 1.2
    ( AWS is mentioned in the first project only . so , the first project duration is 1.2 years . so multiplying 1 with 1.2 )

Google Cloud : 0
Azure : 0

locations: 0
    (For locations we give 1 points , as location is not there in the skillset we give 0 )
Experiences: 0
    (For Experiences we give 1 points , as Experiences is not there in the resume we give 0 )

So the relevant Experiences is :
        must_have percentage = (each must_have value /highest possible value for must_have skills ( 6  As , 2 * 3 (3 is given as the last two projects total duration is 3 years)
))
       [ (6/6) + (0/6) + (3.6/6) +(6/6) + (0/6) + (3.6/6) + (3.6/6 ) ] / 4 ( total number of must_have skills)  = 0.55
             must_have Experience = 55%

Good_to_have value  = Good_to_have Experiences = (each Good_to_have value /highest possible value for Good_to_have skills ( 3  As , 1 * 3 (3 is given as the last two projects total duration is 3 years)
))
       [ (3/3) + (1.8/3) + (1.8/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (3/3) + (0/3) + (0/3) + (1.2/3 ) ] / 16 ( total number of Good_to_have skills)  = 0.225
    
             Good_to_have Experience = 22.5%

Locations percentage = ( Locations value / total number of Locations )
        
        (0/0) = 0
Locations percentage =0%
Experiences percentage  =  ( Locations value / total number of Locations )
(0/1) = 0
Experiences percentage = 0%
relevant Experiences =[ (must_have percentage + Good_to_have percentage + Locations percentage + Experiences percentage )/4]
        relevant percentage= [ (55+22.5+0+0) / 4 ]
        Relevant Experience = 19.37%

must_have percentage = 55%
Good_to_have percentage = 22.5%
Locations percentage =0%
Experiences percentage = 0%
Relevant Experience = 19.37% ]

Demo Answer :
Based on the provided resume, here are the requested details:
Relevant Experience = 19.37%
must_have Experience = 55%
Good_to_have Experience= 22.5%
