    1st skill of the good_to_have is Numpy , so Numpy is mentioned in that two projects . so ,for good_to_have skills we give 1 points . so 1 * 3 (3 is given as the last two projects total duration is 3 years)
    So , Numpy :3   likewise
        Scipy : 1.8
Pandas : 1.8
( Scipy and Pandas is is mentioned in the second project only . so , the second project duration is 1.8 years . so multiplying 1 with 1.8 )
Dask : 0

             Good_to_have Experience = 22.5%


   Locations percentage = ( Locations value / total number of Locations )
        
        (0/0) = 0
Locations percentage =0%
Experiences percentage  =  ( Locations value / total number of Locations )
(0/1) = 0
Experiences percentage = 0%
relevant Experiences =[ (must_have percentage + Good_to_have percentage + Locations percentage + Experiences percentage )/4]
        relevant percentage= [ (55+22.5+0+0) / 4 ]
        Relevant Experience = 19.37%


must_have percentage = 55%
Good_to_have percentage = 22.5%
Locations percentage =0%
Experiences percentage = 0%
Relevant Experience = 19.37% ]

Demo Answer :
Relevant Experience = 19.37%
Must have Experience = 55%
Good to have Experience= 22.5%
